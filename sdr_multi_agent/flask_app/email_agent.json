I'm an AI author, educator, and the founder of a few generative AI startups (including a Y Combinator grad in 2015). Over the past year, I published <b>\"Quick Start Guide to Large Language Models\"</b> (Addison-Wesley, 2nd Ed.), which has become a practical resource for students and professionals looking to understand and apply LLMs in real-world projects with several translations into German, Korean, Chinese, and more.</p><p>I wrote this book to bridge the gap between AI theory and hands-on skills, with code-driven examples covering prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, agents, evaluation strategies, and the latest in LLM experimentation like linear probing.</p><p>If you think your students might benefit from using it as a text or even as a supplemental resource, I would love to chat :) Similarly, if you’re interested in bringing me in as a guest speaker or for a virtual session, I’m more than happy to connect. Here’s my <a href=\"https://calendly.com/sinan-u-ozdemir/30min\">Calendly</a> link if you’d like to book a quick meeting, or just reply here if that’s easier.</p><p>Either way, I’m happy to send you a complimentary desk copy or a digital version if you’re interested. Just let me know!</p><p>Thanks so much for considering, and hope to connect!</p><p>Best,<br>Sinan Ozdemir<br><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sinan-ozdemir/\">LinkedIn</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/sinanuozdemir/quick-start-guide-to-llms\">Book GitHub</a></p>",
